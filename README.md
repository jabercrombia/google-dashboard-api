## **How It Works**
1. **GA4 Tracking**:
   - The project integrates GA4 tracking into the Next.js app to monitor user interactions and page views.
   - Page views are tracked dynamically as users navigate through the app.

2. **GA4 Data API**:
   - The GA4 Data API is used to fetch analytics data programmatically.
   - Metrics such as active users, page views, and session duration are retrieved for analysis.

3. **Authentication**:
   - A Google Cloud Service Account is used to authenticate API requests securely.
   - The Service Account has access to the GA4 property, ensuring data privacy and security.

4. **Custom Reporting**:
   - The fetched data is used to generate custom reports and dashboards.
   - These reports provide insights into user behavior and app performance.
